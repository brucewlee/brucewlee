I'm **Bruce W. Lee**.

- I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania. 

- I'm fascinated by the realm of intelligence, and as a byproduct, I'm also interested in understanding how language functions, encompassing both linguistic and visual systems.

- I use GitHub to maintain some open-source projects, often tied to my research.
